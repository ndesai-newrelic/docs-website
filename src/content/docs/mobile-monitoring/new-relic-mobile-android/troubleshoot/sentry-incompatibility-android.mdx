## Problem

Conflicts, crashes, or errors will show when both the New Relic Android agent and Sentry Monitoring SDK are included within an app.

Known errors:
  - `java.lang.StackOverflowError`

## Solution

Our Android agent Should not Instrument Sentry Android SDK. Avoid instrumenting the Sentry Android SDK to the Android agent with the following configuration.

newrelic {
// Don't instrument sample classes
excludePackageInstrumentation("io.sentry.*")
}
